# Cracking the Coding Interview in Python

This repository is dedicated to solving all 189 programming questions from the book *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. The unique challenge here is that while the book provides solutions in Java, this repository focuses on solving these problems in Python, using the most optimal approaches.

This project serves as a testament to continuous learning and improvement of coding skills.

## Organization

The code is organized into different chapters, each presented in Jupyter notebooks for clear and structured organization. Inline comments are provided where necessary to enhance understanding. Feel free to contribute by writing your own solutions if you believe you can improve upon the existing ones.
